# Demonstration of 3 tasks (trajectory tracking, force control and behave like a Virtual spring) on Osake-1 Robot
This project aimed to implement and demonstrate the three tasks on the OSAKE-1 robot of SysIDEA Robotics Lab(IIT Gandhinagar) using a systematic and generalizable approach of Rotation matrices, D-H Parameters, Jacobians and dynamic equations of motion. The three tasks were to implement codes that allows the end effector to follow a particular trajectory within the workspace of the robot, to reach a specified point on the rigid surface and applies the required force in the particular direction against the rigid surface and to develop a control scheme that allows the end effector to behave like a virtual spring.
- Please refer to 'ME639 Midsem.pdf' for a detailed explanation of the project and its implementation.
- To view the results of each task and gain a visual understanding of the project, please watch the demonstration video available at the following link: https://iitgnacin-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/20110161_iitgn_ac_in/EbQj8LN3ZMpMgBLM06fS4agBhsePa8T0BBNoxFbiVtkpXw?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=bKSxlF
